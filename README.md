Automatic plant watering
========================

This project aims to create an automatic plant watering system using:
- Arduino UNO
- Soil moisture sensor
- Relay module
- Car washer fluid pump

But mostly its for fun and self educational purposes.

Lots of things remains to do:
- Control algorithm for activating relay
- Add control parameters as environment variables
- Save environment to EEPROM
- Create some kind of logging function to record soil moisture over time
  as a help for calibrating the control algorithm
- Clean up environment periodically to remove old entries
